## 📖 What is this?

A plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that turns your documents into an organized, searchable knowledge base.

Give it anything — articles, notes, PDFs, a whole folder — and it will:

1. 💾 **Save** your originals (they're never changed)
2. 📝 **Summarize** each source
3. 💡 **Extract** key ideas into their own pages
4. 🔗 **Connect** related ideas across everything you've added
5. 💬 **Answer** your questions with links back to the sources

Everything stays on your computer as plain text files. No cloud. No database. No lock-in.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Three steps. Everything installs automatically — you don't need to set up anything yourself.

**Step 1 — Install the plugin:**
```
/plugin marketplace add bradduy/wiki-knowledge-compiler
```
Then go to `/plugin` → select the **wiki-knowledge-compiler** marketplace → choose the plugin → **enable scope**. This grants the plugin permission to run on your machine — the `/wiki-` commands will appear after this step.

**Step 2 — Run setup:**
```
/wiki-setup
```
Pick your project size (small, medium, or large). The plugin handles the rest — it installs any tools you need, builds your wiki folder, and even offers to set up [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) so you can browse your wiki visually.

**Step 3 — Add your first document:**
```
/wiki-ingest ~/Documents/my-article.md
```

Done. Your wiki is live.

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do

Each command tells you what to try next, so you always know the next step.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/wiki-setup` | ⚙️ One-time setup (installs everything for you) |
| `/wiki-ingest` | 📥 Add documents — one file, a whole folder, or a URL |
| `/wiki` | 🔍 Ask a question, get an answer with sources |
| `/wiki-insights` | ✨ Find patterns and connections across your sources |
| `/wiki-health` | 🩺 Find and fix problems (duplicates, broken links) |
| `/wiki-update` | 🔄 Refresh the table of contents |

**Recommended order:** `/wiki-setup` → `/wiki-ingest` → `/wiki` → `/wiki-insights` → `/wiki-health` → `/wiki-update`

---

## 📥 Adding Documents

You can add documents in many ways:

```bash
# One file
/wiki-ingest ~/Documents/article.md

# A whole folder (scans everything inside)
/wiki-ingest ~/Documents/research/

# Multiple files at once
/wiki-ingest ~/notes/meeting1.md ~/notes/meeting2.md

# All PDFs in a folder
/wiki-ingest ~/papers/*.pdf

# A URL
/wiki-ingest https://example.com/interesting-article

# Or just paste text directly after the command
```

For folders and multiple files, the plugin shows progress as it works through each one.

---

## 🧪 Example: From Document to Knowledge

Say you add an article about climate change:

```
/wiki-ingest ~/Articles/ipcc-summary-2023.md
```

The plugin creates:

| What | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Summary** | A one-page overview of the article |
| **Concepts** | Pages for key ideas like "carbon budget" and "tipping points" |
| **Topic page** | A "climate science" page linking everything together |

Now add a second article about energy policy. The plugin notices both sources discuss carbon budgets and links them automatically.

When you ask:
```
/wiki How do carbon budgets affect energy policy?
```

You get an answer that draws from **both** sources, with links to exactly where each fact came from.

---

## 🔮 Browse Your Wiki with Obsidian

During setup, you'll be asked if you want [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — a free app for browsing your wiki visually. It's installed automatically if you say yes.

Open your project folder in Obsidian and you get:

- 🕸️ **Graph View** — a visual map of all your pages and how they connect
- 🔙 **Backlinks** — click any page to see everything that links to it
- 🔍 **Search** — find anything across your entire wiki
- ⚡ **Live sync** — new pages from `/wiki-ingest` appear in Obsidian right away

This is optional. Your wiki works perfectly with just the commands.

---

## 📁 What Gets Created

```
your-project/
  📄 raw/           Your original documents (never modified)
  📚 wiki/          All generated pages (summaries, concepts, topics, insights)
  📇 index/         Table of contents (auto-generated)
  📝 log.md         A record of everything that happened
  .data/            Internal working data (hidden)
```

No wrapper folder. `raw/`, `wiki/`, and `index/` live right in your project. If `raw/` already exists, setup just adds `wiki/` and `index/` next to it.

All files are plain Markdown. Open them with any text editor, Obsidian, or VS Code.

---

## 💡 Tips

- 🌱 **Start small.** Add 2–3 sources and try `/wiki` before adding more.
- 🎯 **Be specific.** "What does source X say about Y?" works better than vague questions.
- 🩺 **Run `/wiki-health` occasionally.** It keeps things tidy as your wiki grows.
- ✨ **Try `/wiki-insights`** after adding several sources on a topic — it finds patterns you might miss.
- 🔒 **Your sources are safe.** The plugin never changes your original files.

---

## ⚙️ How Setup Works

`/wiki-setup` handles everything automatically based on your project size:

| Size | Search | What gets installed |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **Small** | Built-in | Nothing extra needed |
| **Medium** | Smart search ([qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd)) | Node.js + qmd (auto-installed) |
| **Large** | Fastest search | Node.js + qmd + MCP server (auto-installed and configured) |

The plugin detects your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows) and installs everything using the right method for your machine. If anything fails, it falls back to built-in search — you're never stuck.

## 📦 Other Ways to Install

### From the Claude Code Marketplace (easiest)

```
/plugin marketplace add bradduy/wiki-knowledge-compiler
```
Then go to `/plugin` → select the **wiki-knowledge-compiler** marketplace → choose the plugin → **enable scope**. This grants the plugin permission to run on your machine — the `/wiki-` commands will appear after this step.

### Clone as a standalone project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradduy/wiki-knowledge-compiler.git
cd wiki-knowledge-compiler
```

Open in Claude Code and run `/wiki-setup`.

### Add to an existing project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradduy/wiki-knowledge-compiler.git /tmp/wkc
cp -r /tmp/wkc/.claude/ your-project/.claude/
cp -r /tmp/wkc/.claude-plugin/ your-project/.claude-plugin/
cp -r /tmp/wkc/{agents,skills,templates} your-project/
cp /tmp/wkc/CLAUDE.md your-project/CLAUDE.md
cp /tmp/wkc/wiki.config.md your-project/wiki.config.md
bash /tmp/wkc/scripts/init-kb.sh your-project/knowledge-base
rm -rf /tmp/wkc
```

Then run `/wiki-setup`.

## 📌 Good to Know

- 📡 **Works offline.** Everything is on your computer.
- 📄 **Plain text files.** No database or special software needed to read your wiki.
- 📑 **PDFs supported.** Complex layouts (tables, multi-column) may not extract perfectly.
- 👤 **Designed for personal use.** Single user.
- 🕐 **Want version history?** Run `git init` in your knowledge base folder.
